title: Fair Trade Software

This is a list of software that I consider to be fairly priced for the user, considering both direct and ad-based revenue models. In general, they are some combination of:

1. Either a fixed price or a low monthly price that reflects the cost of maintainence development and necessary maintainence.
2. Not having monopolistic network effects that let's them exploit their users down the road
3. Not bundled with a content production arm, which tends to create high recurring costs.
4. Supportive of data exports and non-proprietary data formats.

You can add to this list by using this [form](https://airtable.com/shr6VIRHr48Fsao9p). I don't have a financial interest in any software except Insight and Quora, neither of which falls into any category listed here.
