I'm currently working on [Insight](https://insightbrowser.com) the first extensible iOS web browser. Previously, I led product teams at Quora including <a href="https://blog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quora/Now-Taking-Questions-for-Quora-Sessions">Sessions.
      
I still occasionally write on <a href="https://quora.com/Abhinav-Sharma">Quora</a> and have a <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">Twitter</a>.
